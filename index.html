  <p>As a mom of 4 boys who loves to code, I am hoping to break down the stereotypes associated with the label of stay at home mom. Being a SAHM is full-time job which requires many skills. Moms know how to get it done! We work hard, we are task-oriented, we manage many projects simultaneously, and we are committed to successful completion of every task.</p>
